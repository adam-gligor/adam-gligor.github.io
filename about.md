  Hey there! Thanks for checking out my blog!
</p>


## About me  

I'm Adam. I work as a professional software developer with close to 10 years experience. Most of this time I spent working with web technologies, I use .net/c# as my primary programming language.  In my free time I like learning new things, experimenting, tinkering with whatever comes into my hand from construction related things to electronics, also enjoy reading sci-fi novels and fitness.

## The blog

I've set up this blog to document the more interesting things I'm undertaking both professionally and as hobby.

## Thanks
