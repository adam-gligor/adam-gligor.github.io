  Hey there! Thanks for checking out my blog!
</p>


I'm Adam. In my professional life I work as a software developer. In my free time i like fixing and tinkering with things, enjoy reading and fitness and learning new things.

## The blog

I've set up this blog to document the more interesting things I'm undertaking both professionally and as hobby.

## Thanks
