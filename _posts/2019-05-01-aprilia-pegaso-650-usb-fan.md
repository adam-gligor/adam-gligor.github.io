Installing a usb plug and voltage regulator fan on the aprilia pegaso 650

## Installation

Two easy mods I wanted to do since last year. 

A usb charger plug on the handlebar to feed the gps or phone and a fan on the voltage regulator. The voltage regulator on the pegaso is located underneath the seat, cooling is adequate while on the move but at standstill at traffic lights it will get hot quickly. 

I've seen two solutions to improve cooling. One is to relocate the regulator underneath the back fender second to add a fan. The first option is used on the pegaso ie 2001+ model, the advantage of the setup is that it does not require any active components but it requires fabricating a metal bracket to precision specs and the location is still close to tail pipe so cooling efficiency is not that great. 

The second to use a fan provides better cooling but requires cables for power and a very narrow fan. The gap between the seat and the regulator is about 1.5cm, luckily I found a perfect fit pc cooler of size 70mm x 70mm x 5mm

The usb is simple, hook it up to the handlebar wire to the battery, and it doubles as a voltage display to monitor the charge and battery health.


**Next onto the wiring ...**


For optimal user experience everything will be hooked up to the ignition. Ignition on, fan starts to spin, usb gets power, no messing with other switches.

The regulator looks like this:

Tree three yellow wires go to the generator, the red wire charges the battery the green wire comes from the ignition. After studying the wiring diagram I found it was ok to use the green wire. The 7.5A fuse is downstream of this point so for safety I added another fuse, in case the cooler decides to melt down or something.

The final setup is: usb plug installed on the handlebar, wire tucked nicely under the fuel tank, comes out beneath the seat, fan is held in place by two plastic dowels with screws. Positive wires goes through the fuse to the green wire of the voltage regulator, negatives are bolted to the frame as shown on this pic:

The usb and voltage display looks like this:

So far I'm happy with the setup, let's see how well it holds ...
