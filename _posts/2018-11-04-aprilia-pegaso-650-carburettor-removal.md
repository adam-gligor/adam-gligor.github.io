The 36 steps to remove the carburettor from an aprilia pegaso 650 (cube, model '97) 

## Intro 

My '97 model Aprilia Pegaso 650. With the warm season comming to an end, it is time for some mentenance work, i'll start with removing and cleaning the carburettor. 

I am by no means a professional mechanic but I like machines and ocasional challenges. 

To perform this operation I followed the procedure as described in the service manual.

This is the first time I attempt this.

## Procedure 

Outline 

Well the carb's are well hidden, to get to them I have to remove the fuel tank and the exhausts, and a whole bunch of other screws.


Step by step procedure 

 1. Remove the sides
 2. Disconnect the fuel pipes and sensor
 3. Remove the fuel tank
 4. Remove the passager steppers
 5. Remove the exhaust silencers 
 6. Remove the fuel tank suport plate 
 7. Tilt the rear subrame to expose the carbs  
 8. Disconnect the choke cable 
 9. Disconnect the acceleration cable 
 10. Losen the carb fastener 
 11. Extract the carburetors

Start by closing the fuel tap, the manual calls for emptying the tank which I did not do but I figure an almost empty tank will be good enough.

Remove the sides, unscrew 4 screws per side, total 8 screws, allen wrench no. 4

Ready to tackle the carbs ...

Loosen the collars on the carb air intake.

Remove the two upper screws holding the rear subframe, this will allow the subframe to pivot  around the two lower screws and move out of the way. Once the gap is wide enough I fasten the lower screws so that the frame stays in this position

Disconnect the choke cable, the black plastic screw, this has to be unscrewed, then the the choke plunger can be retracted. Disconnect (unhook) the acceleration cable, disconnect the idle cable.

The choke cable connector is a plastic screw, has to be handled gently to not damage the threads.
