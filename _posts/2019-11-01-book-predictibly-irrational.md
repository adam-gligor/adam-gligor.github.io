## Review 

**Everything is relative**

We are are not good at judging absolute value. Instead we derive value by comparing things/options with one another. With this knowledge the out choices can be easily manipulated. Ex. options: printed magazine subscription costs 50, web subscription costs 25, web+printed subscription cost 50. Our tendency would be to choose third option because it's better value.

We tend to compare things that are easy to compare Ex. given A, A-, B (where A- is a slightly worse version of A, a decoy) and A and B are not straight forward to compare the tendency would be to choose A. In real life, choose between buying one of three houses, first is contemporary style, the other two colonial style all are equally desirable. One of the colonial houses (decoy) needs a new roof and and the owner agreed to lower the price a bit to cover the expenses.


**Determining base value**

When we encounter a product we tend to accept the first price that comes before our eyes. This phenomenon called *imprinting* is much like ducklings who follow the first moving object (generally their mother). 

Once the prices are established in our minds they will shape not only present prices but also future prices *arbitrary coherence*

*Anchoring* is priming your brain to influence the first price that you think of. Ex. think of last two digits of the social security number, then for how much are you willing to play for a bottle of wine. The digits will unconsciously influence the answer.

*Herding* happens when we assume that something is good (or bad) on the basis of other people's previous behavior, and our own actions follow suit. Ex. stopping at a restaurant with a big queue in front of the entrance

This association of product to price can be broken by rebranding the product as a novel thing with some differentiating characteristics and unlike the existing product or other similar products

Could it be that the lives we have so carefully crafted are largely just a product of arbitrary coherence, random first imprints that have run wild  Question your habits with everything you do, in fact, you should train yourself to question your repeated behaviors.
