Here's an update on my progress with the freecodecamp challenges. First the sections got reorganized recently. The "intermediate front end development project" got split up into two "intermediate" and "advanced", some challenges disappeared and got replaced by new ones.
As it stands now I'm done with the "intermediates" and have two more to complete from the "advanced" then I can claim the first certificate.

These are the challenges I've completed recently.

  - camper news
  - wikipedia viewer
  - twitch-tv streamers

For improved productivity I picked up a bit of angular, check out the pluralsight course link at the bottom if interested.  The code I built is available both on codepen and github. 

## Camper news
The requirements:

 - User Story: As a user, I can browse recent posts from Camper News.
 - User Story: As a user, I can click on a post to be taken to the storyâ€™s original URL.
 - Bonus User Story: As a user, I can see how many upvotes each story has.

Solution on codepen:

{% include codepen.html user="adamgligor" pen="jWeddM" tab="result" height="300" %}


## Wikipedia viewer
The requirements:

 - As a user, I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
 - As a user, I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.
 - As a user, when I type in the search box, I can see a dropdown menu with autocomplete options for matching Wikipedia entries.

Solution on codepen:

{% include codepen.html user="adamgligor" pen="gPByMG" tab="result" height="300" %}


## Twitch-tv streamers
The requirements:

 - As a user, I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
 - As a user, I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
 - As a user, if Free Code Camp is streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
 - As a user, I can search through the streams listed.
 - As a user, I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account.

Solution on codepen:

{% include codepen.html user="adamgligor" pen="XXOOwK" tab="result" height="300" %}
