## Review 

**Everything is relative**

We are are not good at judging absolute value. Instead we derive value by comparing things/options with one another. With this knowledge the out choices can be easily manipulated. Ex. options: printed magazine subscription costs 50, web subscription costs 25, web+printed subscription cost 50. Our tendency would be to choose third option because it's better value.

We tend to compare things that are easy to compare Ex. given A, A-, B (where A- is a slightly worse version of A, a decoy) and A and B are not straight forward to compare the tendency would be to choose A. In real life, choose between buying one of three houses, first is contemporary style, the other two colonial style all are equally desirable. One of the colonial houses (decoy) needs a new roof and and the owner agreed to lower the price a bit to cover the expenses.



**Determining base value**
When we encounter a product we tend to accept the first price that comes before our eyes. Once the prices are estabilished in our minds they will shape not only present prices but also future prices. Anchoring ....

social security number + pay price for wine

We call this type of behavior herding. It
happens when we assume that something is good (or bad) on
the basis of other people's previous behavior, and our own
actions follow suit.

Ex. break this patter by differentiating from existing products. 

Improve ex. shopping habits 

Assumption that market forces determins supply and demant is false ...
