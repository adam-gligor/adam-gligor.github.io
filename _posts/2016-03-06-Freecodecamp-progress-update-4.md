Here are the final two challenges I had to complete. Code is available both on codepen and github.

## Tic tac toe

A tic tac toe game with ai player. For this i've used the minimax algorithm. Link to a post that explains how that works at the bottom.

This is another game. It's a simulator of an electronic game popular in the 80's.
