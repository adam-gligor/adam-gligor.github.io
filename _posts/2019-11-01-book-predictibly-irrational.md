Experiments to uncover our brain's short-commings ... to behavior, decision making

## Review 

**Everything is relative**

We are good at judging relative value, that is at comparing things, we suck at judging absolute value. With this knowledge our choices can be easily manipulated. Ex. options: printed magazine subscription costs 50, web subscription costs 25, web+printed subscription cost 50. Our tendency would be to choose third option because it's better value among the available options. We tend to compare things that are easy to compare. Ex. given A, A-, B (where A- is a slightly worse version of A, a decoy) and A and B are not straight forward to compare the tendency would be to choose A. 

**The base value of things**

When we encounter a product we tend to accept the first price that comes before our eyes, this is *imprinting*. Once the prices are established in our minds they will shape not only present prices but also future prices *arbitrary coherence*. This price can be manipulated with *Anchoring*. Ex. asking for the last two digits of the social security number before asking how much are you willing to play for a bottle of wine will unconsciously influence the answer. *Herding* happens when we assume that something is good (or bad) on the basis of other people's previous behavior, and our own actions follow suit. Ex. stopping at a restaurant with a big queue in front of the entrance. The association of product to price can be broken by rebranding the product as a novel thing with some differentiating characteristics and unlike the existing product or other similar products.

Considering that our lives might well be just a product of arbitrary coherence, random first imprints that have run wild we should train ourselves to question repeated behaviors and habits.

**Cost of zero**

Free has a gravitational pull. When choosing between two products, then, we often overreact to the free one. Most transactions have an up-side and a downside and humans are intrinsically afraid of loss. When something is free ! we forget the downside.

**Market vs social norms**

We live in two world, one characterized by social exchanges and the other characterized by market exchanges. Ex. lawyers asked if they would offer less expensive services to needy retirees, the lawyers said no. Later when asked if they would offer same services free they overwhelmingly said yes. There is a delicate balance between these two norms. Introducing market norms into social exchanges, violates the social norms and hurts the relationships. Once this type of mistake has been committed, recovering a social relationship is difficult. Market norms override social norms more easily than the other way around, it is sufficient to only mention money.

In economical context money is often the most expensive way to motivate people. Social norms are not only cheaper, but often more effective as well.

**Decisions under arousal**

Much like in "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" all rationale goes out the window when under intense emotions. Avoid getting in a situation that requires decision making when under intense emotions and specially arousal.

**Keeping too many doors open**

In modern times people are beset not by a lack of opportunity, but by the abundance of it. We are continually reminded that we can do anything and be anything we want to be. The problem of trying to do 1,000 things before dying and not stop is that we spread ourselves too thin both emotionally and financially.

What we need is to consciously start closing some of our doors. Small doors, of course, are rather easy to close. We need to drop out of committees that are a waste of our time

**Effect of expectations**

rephrase .. 

When we believe beforehand that something will be good, therefore, it generally will be good—and when we think it the effect o f expectation s will be bad, it will bad. If we acknowledge that we are trapped within our perspective, which partially blinds us to the truth, we may be able to accept the idea that conflicts generally require a neutral third party—who has not been tainted with our expectations—to set down the rules and regulations.

**Power of price**

rephrase

placebo ... 

IN GENERAL, TWO mechanisms shape the expectations that make placebos work. One is belief—our confidence or faith
in the drug, the procedure, or the caregiver.

The second mechanism is conditioning. Like Pavlov's fa-mous dogs (that learned to salivate at the ring of a bell), the body builds up expectancy after repeated experiences and re-leases various chemicals to prepare us for the future.

+ 
FROM OUR EXPERIMENTS with our "pharmaceuticals" we
saw how prices drive the placebo effect.

O N THE BASIS of price alone, it is easy to imagine that a
$4,000 couch will be more comfortable than a $400 couch;
that a pair of designer jeans will be better stitched and more
comfortable than a pair from Wal-Mart;

**Context of our character** ?

about dishonesty ...
