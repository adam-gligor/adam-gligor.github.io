experiments ... log of actions

some moments before you are aware of what you will do next your brain already determined what will do . example experiments 
you then become concious of the decision and belive that you are in the process of making it. exp. 3,4

experiment ilusion of movedemnt from detection not sensory input , exp12 ?

are you producing red blood cells ...

how can we be free as conscious agents if evertyhin we consciously intend is caused by events in our brain which we dont intend adn of which we are entirely unaware ? we cant

ex. let's say your life has gone off track. ... why diet sometimes works sometimes not


you are not in control of your mind because you as a conscius agent are only part of your mind living at the mercy of other parts 
exp. 15

you can do what you want to do but cannot decide what you will decide to do
