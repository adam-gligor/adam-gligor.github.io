can you define an optimal experience in concrete terms ?


Yet we have all experienced times when, instead of being buffeted by
anonymous forces, we do feel in control of our actions, masters of our own
fate. On the rare occasions that it happens, we feel a sense of exhilaration,
a deep sense of enjoyment that is long cherished and that becomes a land-
mark in memory for what life should be like.
This is what we mean by optimal experience.


Contrary to what we usually believe, moments like these, the best mo-
ments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times—although
such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain
them. The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is
stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult
and worthwhile. Optimal experience is thus something that we make hap-
pen.


Such experiences are not necessarily pleasant at the time they occur. The
swimmer’s muscles might have ached during his most memorable race,
his lungs might have felt like exploding, and he might have been dizzy
with fatigue—yet these could have been the best moments of his life. 
Getting control of life is never easy, and sometimes it can be
definitely painful. But in the long run optimal experiences add up to a sense
of mastery—or perhaps better, a sense of participation in determining the
content of life—that comes as close to what is usually meant by happiness
as anything else we can conceivably imagine.



ENJOYMENT AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE
describe 


1. A Challenging Activity That Requires Skills


But by far the overwhelming proportion of optimal experiences are reported
to occur within sequences of activities that are goal-directed and bounded
by rules—activities that require the investment of psychic energy, and that
could not be done without the appropriate skills.

...

skills will be boring, while music that is too
complex will be frustrating. Enjoyment appears at the boundary between

boredom and anxiety, when the challenges are just balanced with the per-
son’s capacity to act.

The golden ratio between challenges and skills does not only hold


true for human activities. Whenever I took our hunting dog, Hussar, for a
walk in the open fields he liked to play a very simple game—the prototype
of the most culturally widespread game of human children, escape and
pursuit. He would run circles around me at top speed, with his tongue
hanging out and his eyes warily watching every move I made, daring me
to catch him.

2. The Merging of Action and Awareness


When all a person’s relevant skills are needed to cope with the challenges
of a situation, that person’s attention is completely absorbed by the activity.
There is no excess psychic energy left over to process any information but
what the activity offers. All the attention is concentrated on the relevant
stimuli.
As a result, one of the most universal and distinctive features of optimal
experience takes place: people become so involved in what they are doing
that the activity becomes spontaneous, almost automatic; they stop being
aware of themselves as separate from the actions they are performing.

4. Concentration on the Task at Hand

is able to forget all the unpleasant aspects of life.
This feature of flow is an important by-product of the fact that enjoyable
activities require a complete focusing of attention on the task at hand—thus
leaving no room in the mind for irrelevant information.


5. The Paradox of Control


“A strong relaxation and calmness comes over me. I have no worries of
failure. What a powerful and warm feeling it is! I

6. The Loss of Self-Consciousness

We have seen earlier that when an activity is thoroughly engrossing,
there is not enough attention left over to allow a person to consider either
the past or the future, or any other temporarily irrelevant stimuli. One item
that disappears from awareness deserves special mention, because in normal
life we spend so much time thinking about it: our own self. Here is a climber
describing this aspect of the experience: “It’s a Zen feeling, like meditation
or concentration. One thing you’re after is the one-pointedness of mind.

When we are unhappy, depressed, or bored we have an easy remedy

at hand: to use the body for all it is worth. Most people nowadays are aware
of the importance of health and physical fitness. But the almost unlimited
potential for enjoyment that the body offers often remains unexploited.
