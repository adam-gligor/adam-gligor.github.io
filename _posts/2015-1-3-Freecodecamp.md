# Freecodecamp - learn to code and help non profits

In this post i'll share my experience with freecodecamp. 
I was looking to improve my javascript kung-fu and knowledge of trendy mv* frameworks preferably by building apps that are usefull in some way.
So hapened that at the time i was exploring what else has github to offer besides git repositories, I found freecodecamp in the top trending repos on github, it's actually number 3 at the moment.

## How it works

Free Code Camp is an open-source community where you learn to code and help nonprofits.
You'll have to work your way through course material, complete challanges and if you prove worthy you'll get to work on real projects. 
There is also a comunity that offers support if you get stuck. Sounded like what i was looking for, so i signed up, that was in December.

To get you an idea about the course material, it is split into milestones, completing a milestone will earn you a certificate, the fist certificate being "front end development certification".
To complete this first milestone you will have to go through courses, solve problems and build small apps.
It is geared towards web development and javascript, you'll learn things like html, css, bootstrap, jquery. 
You'll be working most of the time in the browser whether it's course or problems. 
This is what you'll be doing: 

* Waypoints - are the learning material, organized as step by step tutorials, you are explaind the theory then asked to complete simple tasks. 
* Ziplines - are javascript problems. you'll have to write a function that perform as described, to complete the problem the code has to pass a series of tests.
* Bonefires - are small single page applications that have to be build from scrach, that means: html, css, javascript. Codepen.io is used as the editor and you can use any of you favorite frameworks.


## Impressions so far 

My goal is to complete the first milestone. I started with the course material and completed quite some waypoints, but then I realized that it will take quite a bit of time to get everything completed, it was time for a more efficient strategy.
I learned that for completing a milestone you only have to do the ziplines and bonefires, the waypoints are optional, so skipped all waypoints except the ones regarding topics i was not familiar with and moved to bonefires traight. 

These are around 40 problems in total, and are estimated to take 100h to complete, but you can do them much faster if you have a programming background.
Again I started with the suggested way of working, that is in the browser. This approach works fine, you can use you browsers's developer tools to debug and expriment. 
After a while I found myself wanting a real development environment, so i set up a nodejs and worked in visual studio. Then i only pasted the end results in the browser editor. 
The added benefit is that i have my own copy of the problems I solved nicely in a git repo.

## What's next

So far I completed all the bonfires and moving to the ziplines. Ziplines are about 10 single page applications with an estimated 300h of work.
I also searched a bit about the part of working on real projects, i found a few testimonials regarding that, so I'm curious what will happen once you earn certiciates. 
I'll report back with my progress.
